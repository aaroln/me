Found a dataset with most country's data on electric vehicle sales and charging stations per year from 2011 onwards. 
It also has some interesting data on world projections for the future.
I have been able to graph each country individually. I want to get every country onto one graph and also want to start comparing the growth in sales with each country's policies surrounding electric vehicles. 
Is there a correlation between a positive policy and growth in electric vehicles?
Eager to investigate the dataset further and properly assess each countries electric vehicle situation. 
Had difficulty with exercise1.
