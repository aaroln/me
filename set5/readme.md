Found a dataset with most country's data on electric vehicle sales and charging stations per year from 2011 onwards. 
It also has some interesting data on world projections for the future.
I have been able to graph each country individually. I want to get every country onto one graph and also want to start comparing the growth in sales with each country's policies surrounding electric vehicles. 
Is there a correlation between a positive policy and growth in electric vehicles?
Eager to investigate the dataset further and properly assess each countries electric vehicle situation. 
Had difficulty with exercise1. 

Broke the script temporarily, a problem with indentation.

After Ben helped to solve the problem, I was able to run the test and exercise 1 passed. 

Now onto exercise 2.

Took a bit of googling to wrap my head around recursion. 
Comfortable with the idea now, took me ages to do the abba exercise though. 

Got a bit confused with abba as the text in the exercise said to map from abba to something 
whereas the tests required a different substitution. 
Now that it's done it seems easy, took me a bit too long to figure it out. 

Used a for loop to step through the source word, doubt this is a good way to do it

Now will continue to work on data project
