working on data project
watched YouTube tutorial on 'mat plot lib' 
also starting to organize the dataset, so it will be easier to perform certain tasks
I have managed to create graphs that show country comparisons
Looking at sales data and charging points 
My aim is to also combine this data with the country's policies on EV.
