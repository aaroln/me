Am a bit unsure why we have to use the error catcher at this point.
Confident it will become evident as I get started with the exercises. 
Had to watch a few tutorials on the input function in python.
This helped me to better understand how to answer the questions in exercise 1. 
The first two tasks in exercise1, I didn't have any trouble with.
Was initially confused by stubborn_asker. For some reason I thought that the computer
would be providing the answers.
Once I got out of this moment, I was able to properly get started with the problems.
Understand why and when 'except' should be used.
