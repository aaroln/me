Am a bit unsure why we have to use the error catcher at this point.
Confident it will become evident as I get started with the exercises. 
Had to watch a few tutorials on the input function in python.
This helped me to better understand how to answer the questions in exercise 1. 
The first two tasks in exercise1, I didn't have any trouble with.
Was initially confused by stubborn_asker. For some reason I thought that the computer
would be providing the answers.
Once I got out of this moment, I was able to properly get started with the problems.
Understand why and when 'except' should be used. 
Really enjoyed making the guessing game. 
Made it so the lower bound can't be a negative number.
Also made sure that the upper bound can't be less than the lower bound. 
Only took me about an hour to get the game going. 
Initially had problems getting the game to loop again if a negative number was provided.
Fixed this by making the lowerBound and upperBound initially equal to -1 and ran the while loop when they were still equal to less than 0. 
Definitely going to attempt to create more of these types of games. 
Finally, with exercise 4. I searched up the binary search. I began by doing it on paper to get a grasp of how it works.
I was trying to create a range at first but then realized this wasn't necessary. 
Once I figured out that mid = low + high // 2 was the first step, I was confident that I would finish the task. 
From my trials on paper I knew that if the actual number was lower than the mid then the new high would equal this mid value.
And the opposite if the actual number was higher than the mid. 
Finally I added in the tries and guess. This was the easiest part. 
From my 3 weeks of experience, I can say that the problems always appear a lot more difficult than they actually are. 
Breaking the problem into parts makes the overall process a lot easier. 
It's now time to look for an interesting data set. 
Am curious about electric cars.
