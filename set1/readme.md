Learnt the fundamentals of programming and wrote my first line of code in class. 
After setting up my dev environment on both Windows and Mac, I'm beginning to understand how the course will run. 
On Mac, I initially had problems installing git. Fixed after installing 'Command Line Tools'.
In class, was receiving error message about not having latest 'python module', Ben fixed this with the pip install command. 
Had no problems setting up the dev environment at home on Windows. 
Feeling comfortable working in VS Code. 
Thinking of doing my data project on electric cars.
