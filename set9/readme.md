Want to figure out the exact narrative of my data project. 
Is it everyone compared to Australia, or will I look at other countries in more depth. 
How will include the policies into the presentation. What conclusions could I draw from the relation between policies and sales for example.
At the moment I have bar charts, is there something else I could use to display the data. 
I will need to look at more tutorials.
