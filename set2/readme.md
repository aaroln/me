I was confident with the first questions of exercise 0 and needed a bit of googling to figure out the last examples.
Had no trouble with exercise 1 and was correct with all my estimates. 
Exercise 2 didn't take long, 'CS' code makes it easy to spot errors/bugs. 

Was feeling confident until I reached Exercise 3.
The is_odd example took about 10 min to work out, wasn't sure what the return value had to be. 

The fix_it problem was easy to understand. Took about 10 minutes of attempting to get all 4 parts to pass. Ben informed me of a smarter way to write the code, that required one less return value. 

The first couple loops were easy to comprehend. 

The Star loop took a bit longer to work out. At this point I wasn't confident with the structure of list. Experimentation that allowed me to find the correct answer.
I found that with a lot of these more difficult questions, the best thing to do was print() and return as much as possible to check what each thing was doing. Important in understanding the structure of the lists.  

Completed loop 4 before loop 3, found it easier to create 9 of the same list rather than 9 different lists.
In hindsight, having completed loops 3 and 4, they are both simple. 
If I started off by drawing diagrams to understand what each part of the code was doing I would have been able to complete the loops much more efficiently. 

I had to watch the start of Ben's video on the coordinate loop. Again, in hindsight it seems easy. I think a lot of time spent on figuring what syntax and names I can use and what formatting is correct. I have to spend more time looking at how python formatting and indenting works. 

Loop 6 was easier for me than 5. I understood this one and saw the pattern of x + 1. 

At the last loop now, I understand how to make a list within a list and how the structure works. 
Loop 7 took me a fair while to work out. 
And I am not entirely happy with the code I produced. I was not sure how to extend a list by another list of the same length. I tried using .extend() and .append(). These returned 'None'. After a lot of time spent on this question. I resorted to splitting each list into the indices. 

If I have more time this week I will attempt the question again. I have some work to do: 
Formatting
Names
Syntax 
Understanding the structure of lists and how to extend/add.
