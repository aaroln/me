Have chosen NSW charging infrastructure as my dataset. 
Contacted 'plug share' about attaining their raw data on NSW charging stations.
They informed me that they give that information to companies, not university students. 
Not sure if there is way to get the information straight from the website, as the NSW government website has around 50 locations.
A lot more in Sydney alone. Will work on getting the larger dataset for this week.
Finished the last part of exercise 1, counting the lasers.
The docs/python website was helpful this week. 
Initially, used LOCAL + "lasers.pew", realized that I had to put \\ at the start of lasers.
I found that coding in pairs was useful and helped to keep me focused in class.
Also valuable seeing how other people code and seeing first-hand the different ways a problem solved.
Feeling confident moving into the next week.
