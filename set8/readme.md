Want to create a world map, that shows by saturation which countries have experienced the most total sales over the 10 year period.
This will allow me to target my investigation into certain areas and ask why the sales are higher in this part of the world.
I will then support this map with graphs that show closer investigation of each country and how they compare to Australia.
What is Australia not doing? What could we do now. 
The price of electric vehicles is also interesting. Is this affecting sales in certain parts of the world. 
Most of the manufacturing of electric vehicles happens in Europe.
